# Deep-Recycling
Deep Learning -> Recycling waste ♻️

In this project, TACO 🌮 dataset is used, an open image dataset of waste in the wild containing photos of litter taken under diverse environments. These images are manually labeled and segmented according to a hierarchical taxonomy to train and evaluate object detection algorithms.

GOAL
Use an Neural Network (Mask RCNN), to identify and classify different type of waste, so it can be recycled.
